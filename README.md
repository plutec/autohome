# Autohome
With this project we pretend to make a intelligence environment at home.

we define distinct parts that I will describe in the next points:

## Central
It is constructed in a Raspberry Pi (Model A in this case, but Model B is valid too).


## Terrace
In the terrace of my home we put an humidity and temperature sensor (DHT11) for its cheap and simplicity use.
