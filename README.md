# Autohome
With this project we pretend to make a "intelligente" environment at home.

We define distinct parts that we will describe in the next points:

#Designing
All protoboard and PCB designs are made with Fritzing (http://fritzing.org/)[http://fritzing.org/]

*DEVELOPING!!*

## Central
It is constructed in a Raspberry Pi (Model B in this case, but Model B+ is valid too).


## Terrace
In the terrace of my home we put an humidity and temperature sensor (DHT11) for its price and simplicity of use.

## TemperatureAndHumidity
